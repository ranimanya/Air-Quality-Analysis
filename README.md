# Air-Quality-Analysis
This is AI mini project.
This project is about air quality for a given dataset of New York city. Three 
different algorithms were used to analyse and predict temperature. The project 
aims to determine which algorithm gives best results. The analysis has been 
done in Google Colaboratory and visualization has been done in Tableau public 
2022.3.
Analyzing Air Quality Data and predicting temperature using three different 
algorithms and determine which gives best accuracy.
1. Random Forest
2. Decision Tree
3. Support Vector regression
